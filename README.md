### Notes based on Kotlin for Java Developers course

### https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-for-java-developers/

#### Basic differences between Kotlin and Java
- kotlin compiles to Java .class files
- when using intellij, it seems that the kotlin runtime version used must be the one bundled with intellij
- when packaging a kotlin app, kotlin runtime and JRE must be bundled
- kotlin main() function can be declared without args
- the standard library has a lot of utilities to avoid importing libs
- kotlin uses type inference, so the type declaration may be skipped
- variables declared as VAR can be reassigned
- variables declared as VAL cannot be reassigned
- it's a good practice to declare all variables as VAL and only VAR when really needed
